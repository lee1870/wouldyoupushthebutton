# wouldyoupushthebutton

Would you push the button is an online quiz asking a simple question where the user is asked "would you push the button".

Two things happen when you push the button. These two things MUST happen together.

For example "Would you push the button if"
1. You got 10,000 dollars deposited directly into your bank account.
2. But when you do, you shrink one inch in height.

The user can choose to press it, or not.
Whenever they do, they will increase a counter of whether or not they would press the button.

Users can also submit questions of their own!
